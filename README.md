# Eat Da Burger!
A Burger Logger created using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, Bootstrap, and a homemade ORM.

## Description
The user may enter any burger name to add it to the menu. The new burger entry is added as available on the menu, placed on the left side of the screen, and highlighted green. The user may then eat any burger by clicking on it, which moves it to the right side of the screen and highlights it red.
